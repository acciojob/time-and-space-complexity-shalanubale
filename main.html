<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task.As a programmer,your goal should to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing and making it more efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is related to the amount of memory occupied by the program.for example,if a program takes an array of size n as input,the space complexity of the program becomes O(n)</p>
