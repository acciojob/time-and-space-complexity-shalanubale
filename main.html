<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. An efficient algorithm minimizes the time it takes to solve a problem, which is crucial when handling large datasets. The goal is to design algorithms with lower time complexity to improve overall performance and reduce computation time.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or storage an algorithm uses relative to the input size. One common example is an algorithm that has a space complexity of O(n), meaning that as the input grows, the space required grows linearly. This is important to consider when working with limited memory resources, as inefficient use of memory can slow down or limit the algorithm's functionality.</p>
